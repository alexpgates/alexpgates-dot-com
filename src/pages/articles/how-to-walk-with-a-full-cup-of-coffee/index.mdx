At my first job out of college, I learned something from one of the customer service reps that I’ve used so incredibly often.

I was walking back from the break room with a very very full cup of coffee and struggling with it spilling.

She told me the secret to walking with a full cup of coffee: <span className="font-bold">don’t look at it</span>.

You know how to hold a mug of coffee and you know how to walk. So just do that. When you look at it, you try to correct yourself, and you end up causing the spills.

### Trust yourself

It seems to me that this tiny piece of advice extends beyond coffee spill prevention. It’s a reminder to be confident in things we innately know how to do.
