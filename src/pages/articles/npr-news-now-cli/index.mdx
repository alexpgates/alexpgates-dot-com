NPR publishes hourly news briefs called [NPR News Now](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/500005/npr-news-now) &mdash; _The latest news in five minutes. Updated hourly._

The `npr-news-now-cli` package makes it easy to catch up on the latest news right from a terminal window. It works by parsing the podcast's RSS feed and playing the latest episode using VLC in the terminal.

## Prerequisites

Before you install and use `npr-news-now-cli`, you need to have VLC media player installed on your system as it relies on the VLC bindings for audio playback. Please follow the installation instructions on the [VLC official website](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html).

## Installation

```bash
pip install npr-news-now-cli
```

## Usage

After installation, you can run the tool using the following command:
